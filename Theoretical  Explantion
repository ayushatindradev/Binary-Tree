ðŸŒ³ Binary Trees - Beginner Friendly Tutorial (C++)
ðŸŸ¢ Step 1: What is a Binary Tree?
ðŸ’¡ Imagine this:
You have a family tree, right? One person can have two children. Thatâ€™s how a Binary Tree works.

âœ… Definition:
A Binary Tree is a tree where each node can have at most two children:

a left child

a right child

ðŸ”§ Real-World Analogy:
Think of a folder system in your computer:


Main Folder
â”œâ”€â”€ Left Subfolder
â””â”€â”€ Right Subfolder


ðŸŸ¡ Step 2: Understand the Node
ðŸ§± A node contains:
Data (like a number)

Left child (pointer to left node)

Right child (pointer to right node)

âœ… Visually:

      1
     / \
    2   3
Here:

Node 1 is the root.

Node 2 is left child of 1.

Node 3 is right child of 1.



ðŸ”µ Step 3: How to represent this in C++
Before writing code, letâ€™s plan:

ðŸ“Œ Problem:
We want to store tree nodes and connect them like shown above.

ðŸ§  Approach:
Each node should store a value, and pointers to left & right children.

ðŸ¤” What is Tree Traversal?
âœ… Problem:
We want to visit all the nodes of a binary tree in some order.

ðŸ“Œ Why do we need this?
To:

Print all the values

Search something

Solve problems like sum, height, etc.

ðŸ§  There are 3 Main Types of Tree Traversals (using recursion):
Letâ€™s take this sample tree to understand:
      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \
  4   5
Root: 1

Left Subtree: 2 â†’ 4, 5

Right Subtree: 3

ðŸ”· 1. Inorder Traversal â€“ (Left â†’ Root â†’ Right)
ðŸ“Œ Problem:
Visit left subtree, then root, then right subtree.

ðŸ§  Approach:
Go to the left

Print the current node

Go to the right

âœ… Expected Output: 4 2 5 1 3

ðŸ”· 2. Preorder Traversal â€“ (Root â†’ Left â†’ Right)
ðŸ“Œ Problem:
Visit current node first, then left and right.

ðŸ§  Approach:
Print the node

Go to the left

Go to the right

âœ… Output: 1 2 4 5 3

ðŸ”· 3. Postorder Traversal â€“ (Left â†’ Right â†’ Root)
ðŸ“Œ Problem:
Visit children first, then the parent.

ðŸ§  Approach:
Go to the left

Go to the right

Print the node

âœ… Output: 4 5 2 3 1

ðŸŒˆ Level Order Traversal (Breadth First Search - BFS) â€“ Super Easy Style

ðŸ§  What Is Level Order Traversal?
ðŸ“Œ Problem:
We want to print the nodes level by level, from top to bottom, left to right.

ðŸŽ¯ Think of this:
You're in a building with floors (levels). You want to visit each floor one by one, and read the room numbers left to right.

ðŸŒ³ Tree:

      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \
  4   5
âœ… Level Order Output:
1 2 3 4 5

ðŸ”§ How Do We Do It?
We use a queue. Think of it like a line of people â€” first in, first out.

ðŸ“˜ Step-by-Step Approach:
Start with the root node (1) and put it in the queue.

While the queue is not empty:

Take out the front node and print it

If it has a left child, put it in the queue

If it has a right child, put it in the queue

Repeat until queue is empty
